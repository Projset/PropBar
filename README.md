# Propbar
Shows an custom alert rather than system alert.

## Propbar 2, 1
These older versions are not recommended to be used.\n
Propbar 1 was a base Project which was made with VanillaJS but it contained very silly mistakes.\n
Propbar 2 whereas was improved much further by making it dependent on jScript Library, which was not very likely to be included by developers.\n
Thus Propbar 3 was made again using VanillaJS but with much more options, functionality, animations etc.\n\n
So we recommend using Propbar 3 or above in your projects.\n\n
Propbar 1 and 2 were included just for information purpose only.
