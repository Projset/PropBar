# Propbar
Shows an custom alert rather than system alert.

## Propbar 2, 1
These older versions are not recommended to be used.<br />
Propbar 1 was a base Project which was made with VanillaJS but it contained very silly mistakes.<br />
Propbar 2 whereas was improved much further by making it dependent on jScript Library, which was not very likely to be included by developers.<br />
Thus Propbar 3 was made again using VanillaJS but with much more options, functionality, animations etc.<br /><br />
So we recommend using Propbar 3 or above in your projects.<br /><br />
Propbar 1 and 2 were included just for information purpose only.
